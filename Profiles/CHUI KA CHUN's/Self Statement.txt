// CHUI KA CHUN's\Self-Statement:
  My name is Chui Ka Chun, and I am currently 17 years old, studying for the Higher Diploma in Software Engineering at 
the Hong Kong Institute of Information Technology, where I am in my first semester. I would describe myself as a 
creative and spontaneous programmer with a developing foundation in software development, currently at a 
lower-intermediate level.  

  In terms of academic background, I was the 19th Graduate of Hong Kong Aldrich Bay Government Primary School and 
later the 58th Graduate of Hong Kong Shau Kei Wan East Government Secondary School. During my senior secondary years, 
my elective subjects included Information and Communication Technology (ICT), Design and Applied Technology (DAT), and 
Applied Learning: Computer Game and Animation Design (CGAD) at VTC. In 2023, I completed a 25-hour workshop 
“Strength-Based Group: App Coding (AC02),” further cementing my hands-on skills. Outside of academics, I have been 
active in extracurricular and community service. Since March 2018, I have been a member of the Hong Kong Scouts, where 
I currently serve as part of the 82nd Hong Kong Scouts (Ventures). Additionally, I volunteer as a member of the Hong Kong Boys’ & Girls’ Clubs Association (HKBGCA), contributing to community initiatives and youth engagement.  

On the technical side, I consider myself a creative, self-driven programmer with over seven years of personal experience. During this time, I have explored multiple programming languages and independently gained skills through self-study. My main areas of focus include Python 3, SQL, Java, and website development. This journey began in Primary 4, when I was first introduced to Scratch and Micro:bit during computer classes. That early exposure to programming awakened my passion and showed me the limitless creativity and opportunities within information technology.  

Looking ahead, I aspire to become a professional programmer. My goal is to apply my knowledge of programming and I.T. to unleash creativity, maximize my abilities, and inspire others with my curiosity about the future. I hope to share this passion, collaborate with others, and together confront challenges, while building innovative solutions that reflect both imagination and technical skill.  
Scartch and Microbit respectively. That was my first experience in programming. The 
world of programming and I.T are so fantasy, it filled with an infinite universe. 
From that moment on, I opened my new universe, growing slowly over time, my passion 
and interest in programming is growing stronger and stronger.

  In the future, I'm hope want to be a formal programmer, through my knowledge be side on 
programming and I.T, and unleash your creativity, give full play to your abilities, expand 
and share my universe with others, and infect others with my curiosity about the future, my 
original intention and passion for programming, so that we can go through Poland together, 
work together and face challenges together.
